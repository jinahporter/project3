### Description of Project:
In light of the recent pandemic, COVID-19, many people are struggling financially due to the loss of their job, lower hours or overtime pay.
Credit Card companies determine an applicant’s risk based upon multiple metrics.  It is important to understand how these factors can predict one’s ability to pay.  
We chose kaggle credit application and used two machine learning models for binary classification. The Logistic regression model returned 0.96, so we serialized the data using Python Pickle module and loaded our results using a flask server to a custom webpage. 


### Tools Used:
Python, pandas, sklearn, pickle: Data Cleaning, Machine Learning
Flask: 
HTML/CSS: JavaScript were used to create the web page
